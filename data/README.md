We used a sample of the one of the Kaggle's competition, [Google-Landmarks Dataset data sets](https://www.kaggle.com/google/google-landmarks-dataset). 
We only used 20 classes of the data set, each class including 4980 images of one land marks in differnt conditions and from different angles. We used 80% of that for train and 20% of that for test.
