+ Project summary: 

This project we tried to build some models to recognize the landmark. It is a really interesting topic, imaging when you find some awesome picture on the website, don’t you want to figure out the locations of those places? 

There are more than 7800 images in the training dataset.  We built two models to compare the results, the baseline model and advance model: CNN. For the baseline model:
For the CNN:

Furthermore, we also tried to extract features from images by using HOG. Added the index of for each of the feature extract from the images. Lastly, merged them together to get training dataset and testing dataset.
