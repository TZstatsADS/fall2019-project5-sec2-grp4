# Project: 
### Doc folder

The main.Rmd includes every steps that we take for doing the project. However, since the data-set is was large enough, everyone worked on that based on their local path and the data set is on the github (they are uploded in the google drive and you can find more detail [here](../doc/README.md). You can see everyone's jupyter nootebooks and their results here too.
